            <ul>
                <li>If you are not fully vaccinated and aged 2 or older, you should wear a mask in indoor public places.</li>

                <li>In general, you do not need to wear a mask in outdoor settings.
                  In areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, consider wearing a mask in
                   crowded outdoor settings and for activities with close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated.</li>

                <li>People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may NOT be protected
                  even if they are fully vaccinated. They should continue to take all precautions recommended for unvaccinated
                   people, including wearing a well-fitted mask, until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Masks are required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations.
           Travelers are not required to wear a mask in outdoor areas of a conveyance (like on a ferry or the top deck of a bus).
            CDC recommends that travelers who are not fully vaccinated continue to wear a mask and maintain physical distance when
            traveling.</p>
